message: "I had the privilege of A divine service invading my home! I will be forever grateful for the spectacular transformation they did to my bedroom. Before it was a total shambles and as a single working mother I was desperate for an affordable, efficient and welcoming service. So when A Divine Service came into my home I was absolutely chuffed! Honestly, I went from having hardly having any space to being able to dance around in my room. The staff are extremely welcoming and polite, they respect the instructions and special requirements you may have. I have even received advice on how to get whites crispy white again. Their service is truly sacred and I highly recommend them especially if you want to know the secret to getting those school shirts back to looking brand new! \r\n\r\nGet in touch and enjoy the service, trust me - it's DIVINE."
