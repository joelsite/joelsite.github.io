message: "Hello! My name is John and there's something I'd like to tell you. \r\nI recently did a research on Instagram user statistics and likes/Follower patterns across users, and found out that many users such as yourself suffer from a state of placidity. This means that despite regularly uploaded good content you're unable to grow further. The reason is that most of the regular Instagram users only watch and follow content that seems popular, while overlooking or ignoring content that has a low number of likes compared to the other popular content they follow. Have you noticed that you hit a wall with your account and that regardless of what you do you only stay where you are? If not, it will become apparent to you soon.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why http://www.himzilikes.com was created. By using one of  our packages you can get above the threshold other users consider as unpopular and let your account grow to it's deserved follower size. Just select which package best suits you and your account and after less than 24 hours the package will be active.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nJohn Derring\r\nHimziLikes Foreman"
